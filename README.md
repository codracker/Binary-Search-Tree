# Binary-Search-Tree
To check if a given binary tree is a subtree of another binary
To solve this , I have used two methods:

> isidentical: which checks if two roots are identical or not

>issubtree: which checks if one tree is a subtree of the other binary tree


To test the program 5 test cases are made:

1. Input  :  The root node of source is "None"
   Output : It is not a subtree

2. Input : If source.right.left is changed from 'm' to 'z'
   Output : It is not a subtree
   
3. Input :  If
